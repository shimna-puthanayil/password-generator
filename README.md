## Usage

 The user is presented with a placeholder for the new password and a button to click to generate a password when the application is opened. Up on clicking the button the user will be prompted with certain questions to confirm. Initially it asks for the number of characters to include in the password. User is allowed to enter a number between 8 to 128 . Then a series of confirmations have to be done to select the character types that has to be included in the password. Depending on the selected criteria a random password will be generated and displayed in the placeholder. If the entered password length is less than 8 or greater than 128 then an alert will be displayed asking the user to enter right number. Similarly if the user doesn't include any of the character types then another confirmation message will be displayed to continue or not.
